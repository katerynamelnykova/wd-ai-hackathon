      "\n",
      "**For the Brownie Base:**\n",
      "- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter\n",
      "- 1 cup granulated sugar\n",
      "- 2 large eggs\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n",
      "- 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n",
      "- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n",
      "- 1/4 teaspoon salt\n",
      "- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder\n",
      "\n",
      "**For the Pumpkin Swirl:**\n",
      "- 3/4 cup canned pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)\n",
      "- 1/4 cup granulated sugar\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon\n",
      "- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg\n",
      "- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract\n",
      "- 1 egg\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Preheat the Oven:**\n",
      "   Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease an 8x8-inch baking pan or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Make the Brownie Base:**\n",
      "   - In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Remove from heat and stir in the sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined.\n",
      "   - Add the cocoa powder, flour, salt, and baking powder to the mixture and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; a few lumps are okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Prepare the Pumpkin Swirl:**\n",
      "   - In a separate bowl, combine the pumpkin puree, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla extract, and egg. Mix until smooth and well incorporated.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Combine:**\n",
      "   - Pour half of the brownie batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly.\n",
      "   - Spoon dollops of the pumpkin mixture over the brownie batter, then pour the remaining brownie batter over the top.\n",
      "   - Using a knife or a skewer, swirl the pumpkin mixture gently into the brownie batter to create a marbled effect. Be careful not to overdo it; you want distinct swirls.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Bake:**\n",
      "   - Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs (not wet batter).\n",
      "   - Let the brownies cool in the pan for at least 10-15 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Serve:**\n",
      "   - Cut into squares and serve. Optionally, dust with powdered sugar or serve with whipped cream for an extra touch.\n",

      "#### Ingredients:\n",
      "- 4 oz apple cider\n",
      "- 1 oz bourbon (or rum for a sweeter variant)\n",
      "- 1/2 oz fresh lemon juice\n",
      "- 1/2 oz maple syrup (optional, for added sweetness)\n",

      "1. **Mix Ingredients**: In a shaker, combine the apple cider, bourbon, lemon juice, and maple syrup if using.\n",
      "2. **Shake or Stir**: If you prefer it chilled, shake with ice. If you prefer it warm, simply stir together.\n",
